                    <p>
                        I take the design and functionality of the web very seriously, not only as a developer but as a daily user of it as well. 
                        The internet is one of the most powerful tools on the face of the earth, allowing millions of people access to information, 
                        applications, and tools to make them more productive. Nothing hinders people more in their quest than that of poorly 
                        designed sites which do not function as expected.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Functionality</h2>
                    <p>
                        Every day I learn a little bit more about Javascript. See new ways people are using it. Thinking about ways I would like 
                        to see web pages work. I take working prototypes to my friends and let them play around with my apps, watching to see how 
                        they use my apps, and when my app fails to give them the result they desired. Its these lessons that constantly rethinking 
                        my interfaces, and polishing them for the best experience for the user, going beyond what made sense to me as the developer.
